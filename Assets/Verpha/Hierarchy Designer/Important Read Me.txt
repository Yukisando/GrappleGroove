Hierarchy Designer was remade from scratch. Update 1.1.1 is the first half of this remake, which contains all previous content and more. Update 1.1.2 will include the second and final part of the remake.

If you are updating from an older version of Hierarchy Designer (1.0.0 to 1.1.0.3f) to version 1.1.1 or newer, you must delete the older version, including the 'Saved Data,' as it is not compatible with the new version.

If you are updating from version 1.1.1 or newer, you can ignore the message above and simply import future updated versions into your project, as they will be compatible from now on.

You can now delete this text message.
