  "description": "\"Basic Mesh Combiner\" is a tool that I created as part of a collection. Its primary function is to change the pivot of a mesh from a MeshFilter and export it to formats such as FBX, STL, OBJ, and Asset.\r\nIn addition to the main feature, the tool also includes the following extra features:\r\nMultiple Pivots: Allows you to use multiple pivots and obtain the center from those pivots.\r\nVertex Snap: Enables you to snap on your own mesh.\r\nGet Center: Provides the center of all vertices.\r\nSlider Movement: Lets you change the pivot position using X, Y, and Z sliders.\r\nPlease note that this is a pre-beta version of the tool and will be updated in the future. I'm sharing it with the community because I find it nice to use. If you require additional features, please feel free to email me at detoolsassetstore@gmail.com.",
